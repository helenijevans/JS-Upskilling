// There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas.They compete against each other 3 times.The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
// and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
// as well(draw means they have the same average score)
// 3. Bonus1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
// team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points.Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else -if blocks ðŸ˜‰
// 4. Bonus2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points.Otherwise, no team wins the trophy

// Test data:
// Â§ Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
// Â§ Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123 Â§ Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106
